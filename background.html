<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ePlant is an effort to leverage current thinking about data visualization to help educators and researchers make sense of the ever growing volumes of data describing multiple levels of biological processes that are now available online. For each of the species currently installed, ePlant connects to several web services to download the latest data pertaining to a plant's genome, proteome, metabolome, biochemical pathways, and tissue expression patterns. It was designed to be easily updated and we plan to add additional data and visualization tools in the future.</p>

<p>We have organized our visualization tools with a conceptual hierarchy that progresses from big to small. We use a zoom metaphor to represent moving closer to- or further away from each level of analysis in the hopes that the temporal and spatial connection made from the juxtaposition improves the ability to make conceptual connections as well. We recognize that each level of analysis is unique and arguments can be made for organizing the hierarchy in a different order. Future versions of ePlant will allow users to order the icons according to their personal preferences.</p>

<p>Some of ePlant's visualization tools are implementations of excellent systems you may be familiar with: <a href="http://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape.js/">Cytoscape.js</a> for the protein interactions and reactome charts, <a href="http://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/Jmol_JavaScript_Object">JSmol</a> for the 3D molecular view, and <a href="http://jbrowse.org/">JBrowse</a> for the genome browser. Other visualization tools are based on well known viewers developed at <a href="http://bar.utoronto.ca">bar.utoronto.ca</a>: the eFP browser for <a href="http://bar.utoronto.ca/cell_efp/cgi-bin/cell_efp.cgi">cells</a>, <a href="http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi">tissues</a>, and <a href="http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi?dataSource=Natural_Variation">natural variations</a>, as well as the <a href="http://bar.utoronto.ca/ntools/cgi-bin/ntools_expression_angler.cgi">Expression Angler</a> and other bits and pieces we have reproduced and updated. </p>

<p>Recognizing the forest from the trees is especially challenging when your information must be accessed from separate sources, each with its own interface and methods for identifying and visualizing the data you're interested in. ePlant brings new and familiar data visualization tools together into common framework, minimizing the steps necessary to explore a cluster of genes across several levels of analysis. </p>
