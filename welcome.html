<p>Developed by <a href="http://www.waese.com">Jamie Waese</a>, Hans Yu and <a href="http://csb.utoronto.ca/faculty/provart-nicholas">Nicholas Provart</a> at the University of Toronto, ePlant combines proprietary and familiar data visualization tools with an intuitive user interface to facilitate the easy exploration of multiple plant biology databases.</p>

<p>ePlant uses  a zoomable user interface to  help researchers make connections between DNA sequences, protein-protein interactions, cell and tissue expression patterns, natural variation, and proteomic responses to various experimental conditions. Dynamic links to the underlying data and other information is available on demand.</p>

<p>Originally developed for the <a href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/portals/masc/IAIC.jsp">Arabidopsis Information Portal</a>, ePlant is species agnostic and new plants can be added by following an established protocol. Please contact us if there is a particular species you'd like to add. </p>

<p>Developed in Nicholas Provart's lab in the Department of Cell & Systems Biology at the University of Toronto, ePlant was funded with grants from Genome Canada and NSERC. This is a major update from the original ePlant by <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015237&representation=PDF">Fucile et al. (2011)</a>.</p>

<p>ePlant uses the HTML5 canvas, JavaScript and JQuery. It was designed to work with the Firefox, Chrome and Safari internet browsers. Some features do not work with Internet Explorer at this time.</p>
